AutoMan: Human-Computation Runtime v0.3
---------------------------------------

This is a preliminary release of AutoMan.  Please report any bugs you
may find to the project maintainer, Dan Barowy <dbarowy@cs.umass.edu>.

Presently, we have only tested AutoMan with Scala programs.  In
principle, Java can use AutoMan as-is, but adding official support is
currently on our TODO list.

Building a JAR
----------------

This release incorporates a Make script that can build the AutoMan JAR
for you, including downloading all of AutoMan's dependencies.  The build
script can also build the sample applications that are located in the
'apps' directory.  These applications are the ones used in our paper.

You can build the AutoMan JAR using the following command:

  make automan

If you want to see a list of other targets, e.g., sample applications,
just type 'make'.

Using AutoMan in Your Project
-----------------------------

In your source file, import the Mechanical Turk adapter (Scala syntax):

  import edu.umass.cs.automan.adapters.MTurk.MTurkAdapter

After that, initialize the AutoMan runtime with an MTurk config and
define your tasks.  You may then call those tasks like regular
functions.  Note that these functions return immediately, as calling
a human function runs in a separate background thread.

In order to access data returned by the function, you must call
apply on the object returned by the function and then access the
"value" field in the Answer object, as human functions return
Future[Answer] objects.  E.g.,

  val answer = human_function(args)
  answer().value

Please see the collection of sample programs in the "sample_programs"
directory. This folder contains the programs we used in the technical
report (see below).

Using AutoMan with a Different Crowdsourcing Backend
----------------------------------------------------

We currently only support Amazon's Mechanical Turk.  However, AutoMan
was designed to accommodate arbitrary backends.  If you are interested
in seeing your backend supported, please contact Dan Barowy.

However, we are happy to work with you to ensure that you have all of
the information you need to write your adapter library. We will also fix
any compatibility problems with the AutoMan runtime that you might
encounter along the way.

Memoization
-----------

AutoMan saves all intermediate human-computed results.  In the event
of a program exception or unexpected termination, the programmer may
restart AutoMan and it will reuse any previously-obtained results.  If
you want to discard these intermediate results, delete the
AutomanMemoDB file.  The format of this database is Apache Derby 10.8.
