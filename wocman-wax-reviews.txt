I love the idea and I really want to read the whole paper.

On the business side, I just want to know if there is anyway to detect expensive queries ( those that need many responses for a given confidence interval) earlier, so WoCMAN can stop the process and use some other technique.

This paper will make for a very interesting talk. The class of programming language abstractions presented with WocMan represent and very important contribution when reasoning about the crowd enabled systems. I love the calorie counting example app use case used in the paper.

                      ===== Comments for author =====

WoCMan extends the AutoMan crowdsourcing DSL to a new scenario: getting to good estimates by averaging a large number of bad estimates (i.e., exploiting the *wisdom of crowds*). It's clearly a fascinating and counterintuitive problem, and the statistical framework coupled with the DSL looks like a good approach.

It's also a reasonably good fit for WAX, even though the approximate "computer" involved is made of people, because of the connection to statistics for giving good statistical bounds on result accuracy. It even raises some of the same fundamental questions as "mainstream" approximation work: for example, how should programmers think about defining the quality threshold for this kind of problem?

I'm suspicious about one statistical detail. The workflow gets a sample, determines whether it meets the programmer's confidence interval width/level requirements, and—if the requirements aren't satisfied—gets another sample. This seems to undermine the statistical meaning of the confidence level due to the [multiple comparisons problem][mcp]. The framework may need to apply one of the standard corrections to give valid results (or just abandon the iteration and use a one-shot approach instead).
